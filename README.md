# NCAA Predictor
NCAA Predictor is a project I am working on to get a better understanding of web scraping & data analysis while using Python.  I scraped the data from [https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/) and created the bracket (for easier result tracking) on [ESPN Tournament Challenge](http://fantasy.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2019/en/).   
## Predictor Results
### Brackets
I created a bracket based on the teams predicted chance to win the championship.  Teams were picked to go all the way until they faced another team that had a higher chance than they did.  Below is an image of a bracket I completed using the generated picks first and then filling in the remaining with my own judgement.

### Table
Table of the predicted winner mean probability, calculated over 10 test runs, and ordered by most to least probable (teams with predicted probability of 0% are ommitted): 

| Gonzaga | Buffalo | North Carolina | Duke | Michigan State | Auburn | Virginia | Villanova | Prairie View | Murray State | Belmont | Liberty | Houston | VCU | Georgia State | Kansas | Tennesssee | Mississippi |
