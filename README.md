# NCAA Predictor
NCAA Predictor is a project I am working on to get a better understanding of web scraping & data analysis while using Python.  I scraped the data from [https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/) and created the bracket (for easier result tracking) on [ESPN Tournament Challenge](http://fantasy.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2019/en/).   
## Predictor Results
